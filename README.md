# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This assignment was to create a e-commerce backend fully functional system, while interacting with MYSQL database. I created routes for Categories, Products and Product Tags and tested them on Insomnia. They are fully functional on the server. I found this assignment to be not quite as challenging as others but I still had to work at it. In the end I think I've fulfilled all assignment requirements.
